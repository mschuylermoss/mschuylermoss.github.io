Hi, I'm Schuyler! I am a first year master's student at the University of Waterloo where I work with Roger Melko and his group which is housed in the Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Lab, or the [PIQuIL](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/perimeter-institute-quantum-intelligence-lab-piquil). I did my undergraduate studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I studied physics and mathematics. Though my research experience spans a number of fields, I mostly worked with Joaqu√≠n Drut and his [Computational Quantum Matter](https://drut.web.unc.edu/) group.
