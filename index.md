Hi, I'm Schuyler! I am a first year master's student at the University of Waterloo where I work with Roger Melko and his group which is housed in the Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Lab, or the [PIQuIL](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/perimeter-institute-quantum-intelligence-lab-piquil). Previously, I studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I studied physics and mathematics, earning Highest Honors for the defense of my [senior honors thesis](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/honors_theses/kk91fs099). Though my undergraduate research experiences span a number of fields, I mostly worked with Joaqu√≠n Drut and his [Computational Quantum Matter](https://drut.web.unc.edu/) group.

 
## Film Photos

I take lots of photos on a camera that my dad used when he was in college. It's a 1980's era Nikon FG that shoots 35mm. Here are some of the shots that I am particularly fond of.
