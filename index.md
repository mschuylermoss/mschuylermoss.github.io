Hi, I'm Schuyler! I am a PhD student at the University of Waterloo where I work with Roger Melko and the Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Lab, or the [PIQuIL](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/perimeter-institute-quantum-intelligence-lab-piquil). Previously, I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I studied physics and mathematics, earning Highest Honors for the defense of my [senior honors thesis](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/honors_theses/kk91fs099). Though my undergraduate research experiences span a number of fields, I mostly worked with Joaqu√≠n Drut and his [Computational Quantum Matter](https://drut.web.unc.edu/) group.
 
## Research Updates

My first project as a graduate student was [recently published in Physical Review B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.205108). This was a really nice project and there are lots of interesting opportunities for follow up projects (so stay tuned)! I also worked with some great people, which made it even more fun. I got to present this work at the Toulouse School for Machine Learning and Quantum Many Body Physics in April 2022, at the IAIFI PhD Summer School in August 2022, and at the 21st annual International Conference on Recent Progress in Many-Body Theories, where I was recognized as one of the [best student presentations]{https://tarheels.live/rpmbt21/2022/09/18/laptop-awardees-announced/}.

I am currently working on a couple of those aforementioned follow up projects in addition to some new and exciting applications of [RNN Wavefunctions](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023358).

## Non-Physics Fun

When I am not working, I'm likely sitting on my front porch reading, tracking down the best cup of coffee, partaking in some form of cardio, or getting lost in the woods. I've never met a body of water I didn't like, I'm a competitive but indcredibly mediocre chess player, and I love talking to strangers.

I am currently training for a half-marathon and it has felt really good to put more effort into my running! After the half (Dec 10th), all energy will go towards winter activities (my favorite) like skating, cross-country skiing, and downhill skiing whenever possible.

## Film Photos

I take lots of photos on a camera that my dad used when he was in college. It's a 1980's era Nikon FG that shoots 35mm. Here are some of the shots that I am particularly fond of.
